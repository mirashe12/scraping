An outlook healthcare year 2040, impact human lives. - Blackcoffer Insights

Are afraid robots jobs nurses, doctors, healthcareprofessionals? Are scared artificial intelligence control world acouple years?COVID-19 revealed vulnerable health care industry change structural technological transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic unwelcome reminder health matters individuals society global economy. Improved health accounted one-third GDP capita growth developed economies past century.
The traditional boundaries industry dissolve roles emerge future health exponential innovation propels industry 2040. By 2040, health care today longer exist. There fundamental shift “health care” “health.” And disease eliminated, science, data, technology, identify earlier, intervene proactively, understand progression consumers effectively actively sustain well-being.
The future focused wellness managed companies assume roles drive transformed health ecosystem. As rate technological evolution continues speed up, companies ahead proactively plan future. For healthcare industry, particular, pressing compounded pace declining health society. Ray Hammond commented healthcare 2040:
“Healthcare arenas stake. The 20 years witness profound change healthcare, notable medical science healthcare delivery tend conservative, slow-moving sectors highly resistant change. The annual global market estimated worth $8.1 trillion, annual global spending healthcare forecast rise $18.28 trillion 2040.
With mind, collective responsibility generation determine change impact us.” How health promote economic growth? First, fewer people die prematurely working-age population increase. When people healthier, absences sickness decline workers distracted managing conditions loved ones. Also, fewer workers retire early health conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit people underlying health conditions hardest—for example, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, obesity, common world’s economies. We improve health world’s population, build resilience future pandemics dramatically improve quality life millions people suffer heavy dailythe toll chronic conditions.
Actions programs adopting healthy behavior, expanding access primary care, improving medication adherence—could reduce global disease burden 40% 20 years. We found reduction disease burden deliver tremendous benefits: 65-year-old 2040 healthy 55-year-old today, infant mortality decline 65% 230 million people alive 2040. More 70% health benefits prevention healthier environments, healthier behavior, preventive care (including safe childbirth, vaccination, adherence medications lower risk) treatment diseases.
One improve health invest communities children grow live long healthy lives adults. The remaining 30% benefits found proven therapies treat existing health conditions. “Future health care wellbeing” report authored internationally renowned futurologist, Ray Hammond presents future developments trends healthcare 2040.
Among report’s key healthcare predictions 2040 are:
• Health information traditional annual physical check-ups tests previously surgery lab replaced data sensors on/around ‘smart’ bodies (including clothing and, eventually, skin blood). This immediately accessible us, real-time.• A field ‘predictive medical data mining’ provide early warnings physiological trouble ahead indications disease develops. Physicians 24/7 real-time reports patients’ wellbeing alerted change patients’ data requires urgent attention.• Stem-cell medicine powerful tool mainstream medicine. For example, replacement human organs transplant grown demand stem cells lab, minimal risk rejection• Nano-medicine (in infancy 2019) eventually outperform branches medical science, scientists create ‘designer drugs powerful today’s drugs• Artificial Intelligence (AI) ‘chatbots’ equipped deep learning algorithms relieve emergency room personnel tending large numbers walk-in patients non-emergencies (e.g. sore throats, UTIs).

The 10 archetypes fall distinct, interconnected, categories:
• Data platforms: These archetypes foundational infrastructure forms backbone tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They generate insights decision-making. Everything build data platforms underpin consumer-driven health.• Well-being care delivery: These archetypes health-focused groupings made care facilities health communities—both virtual physical, provide consumer-centric delivery products, care, wellness, well-being.
• Care enablement: These archetypes connectors, financers, regulators thathelp make industry’s “engine” run.
All components fully functioning integrated future health life.The future healthcare shaping front eyes advances digital healthcare technologies, artificial intelligence, VR/AR, 3D printing, robotics, nanotechnology.
