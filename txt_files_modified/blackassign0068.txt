But closer look, managers, weren’t great careers football players. Any naïve observer build fallacy causation correlation don’t great career football player great football manager. But restricted football? Mike Brearley, greatest captains history cricket author book art captaincy, wasn’t prolific batsman time. Our President, A P J Abdul Kalam didn’t political background, appointed president country finest presidents country had. So, stated confidence great leaders expert respective fields?Let’s understand leadership role, types leaders, explore perspectives arrive conclusion.
Let’s start understanding leader. A leader position designation. It’s virtue employed correctly. From janitor CEO, student researcher, content writer philosopher leader. (#leadersareeverywhere) So, virtues leader? One famous personality trait theories, Big 5 personality trait theory linked closely leadership. As researches, personality traits extraversion, openness, conscientiousness leaders traits. Not humble empathetic considered adjectives frequently leaders. But technical expertise related leader. #NOTSOTECHNICAL
As stated Colin Powell Leadership art accomplishing science management possible. #It’sART If leadership art leaders artists leaders viewed directors films organizing, arranging, managing, directing scenes. Another analogy orchestra conductor baton/stick set rhythm band. So, conductor great violinist? No. When corporate sector leader expert technology technology functions he/she utilize way. They allocate task building technology technical experts. And leaders identify person job? Or leaders qualities person? #Experience. Every great leader started frontline workers bottom pyramid hierarchical structure. Even technical expertise respective fields, visionary outlook, management skills, experience gathered helped achieving targets. Leaders assistance subject matter experts guide situations technical difficulties. As great man, situational trait theory leadership, leadership innate person. Leadership conditioned brought person rewarding him, great leaders show unconditional attachment vision. Everyone read map, path choose isn’t taught. Leaders give direction vision company drive closer target company achieve. Leadership theories don’t focus technical knowledge leaders, people skills, approach problem, guide hire job done, evident managerial skills required Robert Katz.

But today’s competitive world leaders can’t dimensional. They expertise multiple areas top. Mike Brearley chance play T20 match, won’t picked aside, age, great batting statistics(#Thegamehaschanged). His leadership skills won’t squad. But great leader selected coach top 15 captains world today. As discussed film directors, job isn’t teach cameramen set operate (lens settings, etc) camera. Their job guide cameramen angle held coordinate lights crew perfect shot captured. So leader technical expert field, approach mindset, understands system process, hire talent job work guiding talent, vision.
So, answer question, paragraph, no. Depending position hierarchy (yes front-line manager CXO) type leader are, level technical expertise needed varies. Though stated earlier Robert Katz, CXO’s amount technical expertise, CXO technology functions applications. What processes build technology. He done, (#itsnothowitswhat).
