Will machine replace human future work? - Blackcoffer Insights

Where disruptive technology taking us? Take leave it, disruptive technology creates jobs depleted jobs. You notice jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots, machines, technology creating machines replace them. Technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Machine Learning (ML) algorithms predict drive consumer behavior. Data Analytics tools, Google Analytics , today free, and, correctly, organizations save millions, billions dollars sales marketing.
Before I on, I it’s level set constitutes machines. In context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment, robots, programmed learn, humans. Occasionally call Artificial Intelligence (AI), times call machine learning, times call robotics. And yes, technically things. These bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day. They tough tasks considered difficult human being. But, broad discussion related future work, totally interrelated. Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside them. A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily them. But forward step & advancement technology, threat proliferating, threat replaced work front. Every passing day sealing jobs humans globe. Similarly, turn hand-drawn sketches (done humans) digital source code.
Companies developing robotics expertise idea technological innovations they’ll
Of course, it’s machines creatives working either. In example, Amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things increased warehouse workforce 80,000. Humans, Amazon’s case, picking packing goods robots move orders giant warehouses, essentially cutting “down walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient tired.” Plus, robots “allow Amazon pack shelves cars rush-hour traffic longer aisle space humans. The greater density shelf space means inventory roof, means selection customers.”
During decades (or sooner), notion work handled human virtual hinge predictability. As starting today, machines manage routine humans unpredictable – tasks require creativity, problem-solving, flexibility. In context, robotics means improve operations efficiency improve quality life workers.
Although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation, true highly repetitive tasks—and mechanical ones—are ideal robots. Besides greater efficiency speed, automation leads lower risk accidents, greater control autonomy, all, fewer costs organizations.
Although artificial intelligence machine learning make robots endowed superior intelligence, fact don’t ability learn experience respond unknowns. So things stand, processing speed automatic learning robot has, doesn’t beat factors innate human brain. Humans essential part process. Think delivering services client. Most customer challenges routine, humans play important role addressing issues, solving time appear, consolidating process system.
While machines humans proximity, robots expensive, doesn’t apply types, based Robotic Process Automation (RPA), development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs.
Moreover, domestic robots—be vacuum cleaner, lawn mower pool cleaner—are increasingly part daily lives. This level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control, security comfort.
The division humans machines clear – I’m here, machine – boundary fuzzier. Smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies, making lost limbs providing additional strength, stability, resilience, exoskeletons donned assembly line workers.
We smartphones symbiotically, integrated directly bodies? Think smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain. Think sounds science fiction? Think again. The prototypes built.
Soon, brain-computer interfaces seamless well, creating synergistic relationship cloud us. At point, question moot; question I answer. Sometimes answer stored neural circuitry, time connection neurons web. Our brain’s decision process influenced “educated” cultural context. These external factors influencing decision processes point situations, legitimately claim influence strong brains can’t held accountable choices made. The point I’m make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools – physical conceptual – taught use. My guess transformation subtle.
Practically speaking, robots growing point world start creating smarter, robots impractical concern. None expected future, long shot. If you’ve ATM, waited PC boot catastrophic failure, game crash box reach checkpoint, understand world machines perfectly right. Before jobs, theirs’ flawlessly; then, depend humans mess lives.
This isn’t win-or-lose situation. We’re wind partner smarter machines, partnership fostered augmentation technology. Machines play essential role augmentation and, successful technology, fall level perception. In end, revolution silent invisible.
