Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining - difference

“Data oil” important trendline 21st century. The reason advancements fields related data analysis. The field Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace, fields popular buzzwords days.
Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress. This main reason misconception people. AI, ML, Stats, Data Mining, fields related analysis data mistook thing, words interchangeably convey thing. But true all!
The similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “information”.
In academics, learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining, academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored, case articles explain difference. Thus, primary confusion learners. Hence, article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions.
The essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach achieve aims.
The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities. Then satisfy aim, understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent? The answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror! Yes! Humans examples intelligent entities. Thus, 1900s, researchers began exploring thought process, reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior aim initial years research. After setting goal, studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks, sufficient fool interrogator. But test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence. Because intelligence related working human brain human brain, intelligence meaning!
Thus, mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim. The field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process. The difference understand thought process mimic it, build it. The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain. So, basically, initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent.
Concurrently, field computer science developing greater pace. With advances computer science, experiments theories easily tested validated. As programs applied solve real-life problems, found computers performed humans tasks complex humans. One examples chess-playing program. An program defeated world’s chess player Garry Kasparov. This incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program. This leads question, human intelligence ideal intelligence?
As computers advanced, proved humans complex tasks. That definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems. So, nature agents, researchers began study nature intelligence itself. Then question test validate intelligence? The test intelligence solve cognitive problems. An agent intelligent solve complex problem. The problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers. Thus, researchers began studying ideal intelligence, selected agent validate experiments computer. So, computer problem-solving approach adopted. So, human-centered approach computer, problem-solving approach main aims AI. Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights.
Both aims important collaboratively form main aim AI!
In problem-solving approach, big challenge overcome order achieve aim. Consider solving math problem. There cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach. Let math problems solve. The problem familiar problem not.
Consider problem. The problem familiar you, means solve kind problems solved similar problems past. So, question, mind solve problem? The answer is, solved similar problems past, learned past data, solve problems, haven’t problem past, solve similar problems. This form intelligence.
Consider case problem solved kind problems past. Then solve problem, consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion. This kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. This kind intelligence.
For build intelligent agents, kinds intelligence developed agent. But, reality reached point build agents learn past data find information. today reached point build agents own. That type intelligence.
So, implement type intelligence Machine Learning! So, domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning. That reason ML called subset AI! So, main difference ML.
Technically speaking, “It field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions, patterns explicitly programmed”. This statement elaboration. The essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data. Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. Consider humans recognize daily life objects. If animal, easily recognize “dog” “cat”. It trivial task wondered mind it? The answer Generalization!
If picture dog, easily recognize picture dog, because, minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog. So, dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds.
With generalization only, real “information”. So, give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own.
This discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics deal data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics.
Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics. It explain information possible, easily large data complex task otherwise.
Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data. We inference tasks daily lives. Consider simple case cooking soup. After completing recipe, taste small sample, is, spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. Depending result sample, make inference soup soup whole, good bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. For example, case gather data time-consuming costly. In cases, applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty. That inferential statistics help.
So, data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, data, statistics explain data. This aim resonate ML, statistics fields correctly interpret data!
“Data”, raw form. Consider examples sensors industrial applications. These sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature, pressure, etc. The raw data generated sensors converted suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, solve problem!
Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets, gather insights, Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery”. That why, Carly Fiorina, CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. This statement completely explains aim Data Mining!
So, difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. But approaches fields, fulfilling aims fields. This beauty fields!
