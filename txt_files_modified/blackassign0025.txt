Rise Electric Vehicles Impact Livelihood 2040 - Blackcoffer Insights

In 2020 India 5th largest automobile market world. While fact good news automobile industry, bad news environment. How? Well, India 3rd largest oil-consuming Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According Assessment Report (AR6) Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change (IPCC), 2020 lockdown, complete economy shut 36 50 big cities India unhealthy air quality.
Taking account current situation studies, vehicles annually contribute 290 Giga grams PM2, time, 8 percent total GHG (Green House Gas) Emissions India transport sector Delhi, exceeds 30 percent account promises made India decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog electrify India’s 2W segment 2025 3W segment 2030. India aimed create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV) 2030. While experts goal ambitious hybrid Electric Vehicles (EVs) Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) India decade India ushering goal faster fashion. And give reasons it:
 So basically, war Ukraine Russia never-ending Russia exporter crude petroleum world, rates petroleum International market skyrocketing India 3rd largest oil-consuming nation 90 percent oil imported, lot India’s money driven controlled. Moreover, lockdown people stay distance people afford personal vehicles public ones. This India largest market automobiles, population. The effect rising oil prices (touching 100rs mark then) products well, transportation costs increasing inflation course.
Therefore government hoping control import bills EVs (Electric Vehicles) Hydrogen Running Vehicles. But (no matter said, there’s India) here’s catch hasty push increase country’s import bill. How? Well, EV components imported China, worry about, huge Indian Automobile Industries make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made India, informed smart consumer.
Now let’s government issue currently:
 Since battery costs 70 percent total manufacturing cost EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry Road Transport Highways) ‘Battery service business model. The government allotted budget 100 crores latest budget. The government working applying Fame Policy spend 86 percent Consumer Incentives 10 percent Charging Infrastructure. The government attract FDIs import Li (Lithium) make batteries. The government promised build charging infrastructure.
The government launched e-portal e-amrit.niti.gov COP26 Summit Glasgow. The portal insight major benefits EVs (Electric Vehicles). The major benefits talked are:
 Zero Tailpipe Emission (ZTE) Lower Running Cost Lower Maintenance Less Tax Environmental Benefits Easy Drive Quite
You feel government adamant “ICE EV 2030” mission, let’s talk government add mission. The double Dividend Hypothesis David Pearce 1991 states environmentaltaxation improve economic environmental conditions recyclingrevenues obtained reduce pre-existing taxes. Norway toll free parking people EVs incentive. Sweden France give tax levitation people EVs.
Now let’s chitchat bit problems consumers switch toEVs: Short driving range EVs Long Battery Recharge Time Lack charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life High cost commercial electricity Poor roads
If India forward EV future build good road network isproven carbon emission ICE lesser good roads driving range EVs alsogreater good roads.
Now let’s talk affect livelihood future 2040. So give yousome expert’s predictions conclude article : According Crew Report demand power expected rise 80 percent. About 75 percent vehicles EVs. This usher Railways large distances. Let’s forget air transport well. Transportation cost goods decrease Imports decrease large amounts. Empty petrol stations (better converted charging stations) And writing reading self-solarized EVs.
The obvious (chuckles) read far, share small, additional important information summarized prediction. So, EV trade route Philippines, Japan, US. And The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel) batteries EVs Rio Tuba, mine, Japan purifies The US makes batteries EVs. Now demand increasing, mining Rio Tuba increasing affecting Rainforests Philippines ecosystem, making question “Is solution?”
And I predict: High prices nonavailability batteries parts world.
