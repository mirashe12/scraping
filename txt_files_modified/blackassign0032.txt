Will Machine Replace The Human Future Work? - Blackcoffer Insights

“Anything give rise smarter-than-human intelligence – form Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands contest change world. Nothing league.”
–Eliezer Yudkowsky, Researcher
There’s denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives. Just grocery store, highway, everywhere. This makes replace human intelligence? What make relevant tomorrow? Let find answers questions more.
Let’s understand Artificial Intelligence –
Artificial Intelligence basically machines displaying intelligence. This machine playing chess robot answering questions Facebook. Artificial Intelligence broken types. There AIs designed specific tasks, detecting specific type cancer. However, AIs multiple tasks, driving car. There types AIs. Among top, important fields Machine Learning ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing NLP.
Machine Learning idea machines prove similar human learns skill. Machine Learning optimization existing skill. Machine Learning fields application entertainment. Netflix Machine Learning recommend shows watch based shows seen.
Neural Networks algorithms modeled human brain. These algorithms give similar results human give. Artificial Neural Networks medical fields diagnose cancers lung cancer prostate cancer.
Computer Vision idea computers visions. This things human beings potentially human beings do, depending programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision autonomous vehicles navigation place another.
Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say. An Siri. Siri listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched.
Now do, Let’s talk issue.
AIs automation jobs, replacing humans do. This means job loss concentration wealth selected people. This destabilization society social unrest. In addition social unrest, improves time. This means smarter, faster, cheaper implement repetitive things humans do, preparing fast food. It predicted improve 50 100 years super intelligent. This means smarter intelligent human earth. According experts Elon Musk, end human civilization. potentially start war humans, burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. At point, theory, stop thought obstacles prevent goal. This means unplug machine, effect replace human intelligence.
But, happen 10 30 years?
NO! The field Artificial Intelligence sophisticated human tasks humans do. Currently, smart empathetic humans strategically solve complex problems. solutions expensive tests standards implement. It takes time improve. For example, Boston Dynamics, world’s top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk. Fast forward 2019, robot walk jump objects, backflips more. In addition timing, takes time price technological solution drop point affordable. For example, desktop computer costs $1000 1999 significantly powerful laptop exact price. curve.
But 10 30 years? Will make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. As proven earlier faster cheaper. As happens, companies technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. As demonstrated, repetition machine learning. The difference learn faster time progresses due amount data today. It learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills. However, repetitive routine tasks better, understand emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity. This distinct example- IBM
IBM IBM Watson program create movie trailer. Fox approached IBM movie coming #Scifi horror. They asked IBM platform IBM Watson trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary,
Sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner. IBM Watson generate trailer movie Morgan. The result, movie trailer created machines – Google
2018 google demonstrated assistance calls simple stuff. The set appointment! What fascinating understand nuances conversation. The receptionist thought human calling her. That primitive version technology. Eventually, conversations human beings do, making sales jobs obsolete. – generated art
In 2018, Paris art collective consisting students artificial intelligence generate portrait. It generated portrait painting studying set fifteen thousand art images wiki art. It estimated worth thousand ten thousand dollars. The painting sold auction thirty-five thousand US dollars.
However, replace human intelligence. This society started hard questions questioning ethics. Elon Musk founded Open AI, research lab purpose promote discover artificial intelligence benefits humanity. In addition this, factors affect long-term outcome replacing human intelligence. Like, degree humans over? Depending field, people Artificial Intelligence them? Or prefer human counterpart? While control long run, secure short-term future.
Strategic creative thinking
The ability box human. There thousands thousands slightly outcomes result distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes sophisticated manner achieve. As billionaire founder Alibaba, Jack Ma famously – “AI logic, human beings wisdom”.
Conflict resolution negotiations
With understanding complexities human-related processes ability improvise judge, equipped deal conflicts robots be.
recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces. Humans, lesser greater degrees, capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. With application intuition delicately worded elusive languages, methods, properly judge person feels.
Interpretation Gray Areas
Robots computers function presented quantifiable data. However, situation enters gray area, term refers morals, processes, definitions robots falter.
Critical thinking
Humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. While system analyze documents true false statements made text, judge written analyze implication words meaning content.
