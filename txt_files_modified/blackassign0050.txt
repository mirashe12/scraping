Environmental impact COVID-19 pandemic – Lesson Future - Blackcoffer Insights

The Covid- 19 pandemics forced factories shut down, flights canceled massive decrease global economy, significant decrease Green House Gases (GHG) developed developing countries.
The SARS- CoV2 spotlight December 2019 impacted countries till then. Nearly 131 million peoples infected worldwide resulting deaths 2.9 Million World Health Organisation (WHO). Most countries dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus. These policies caused adverse effects worldwide. One important impacts Covid-19 Pandemic environment.
There positive impacts environment due lockdown like, air pollution decreased dramatically, people asked stay houses due lockdowns. There sharp decline environmental noise. Environmental noise defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities noise emitted road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, industrial activities. It important challenges modern era noise pollution adverse effects humans harm animals too. The imposition lockdown quarantine nation’s governments caused people remain back homes. Because this, movement people place place reduced significantly personal public transport decreased. Due changes, environmental noise generated cities dropped substantially.

Water Pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted back cities, covid-19 virus generated negative indirect effect environment.
To begin with, developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic. In United States European nation-States, waste recycling plants suspended municipalities cities due concern virus spread recycling centers. This resulted increase single-use plastic bags re-usable bags leading restaurants, firms, corporations. For instance, Starbucks, leading coffee company month March 2020, announced short-lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups.
Furthermore, people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores, shops, restaurants, food outlets closed, making online purchase food delivery high. This created consumption demand fossil fuels due transportation mobility goods individual. There enormous upsurge medical waste- products employed healthcare professionals single-use items disposed of. Some wastes include masks, personal protection kits, gloves. For instance, 200 tons medical waste generated peak pandemic breakout Wuhan, China. This 50 tones average waste generated outbreak Wuhan.

These organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment environmental issues water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, harm local flora fauna.
The demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non-woven fabrics. Polyester, Polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, common materials surgical mask density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq. meter. These materials resistant liquids plastic-based products high afterlife discarded. If treated properly discarding, end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. For example, recently environment Hong Kong started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes.

With recycling plants hold, piles small mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day. This makes surrounding vulnerable creating high risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays Methane (CH4), greenhouse gas, increasing risk global warming too. Not surroundings affected careless methods, local people affected. If excess methane accumulated Earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes, result increases Earth’s average temperature harmful future generations.
Many protected endangered flora fauna facing greater risks due imposition lockdown. Many countries lockdown made people stay inside homes. The employees, NGOs, volunteers working protected areas National Parks, Marine Conservation Zones, wildlife sanctuaries made stay home making protected endangered flora fauna unattended. This led increase illegal activities wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, fishing activities due absence people. The prohibition eco-tourism led significant financial drop economy protected areas.
Some nations China asked local authorities native government bodies increase amount disinfection routine, increase dosage chlorine wastewater treatment plant prevent spread COVID-19 virus. However, (2020), solid evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater drinking water. Despite fact excessive amounts chlorine water harmful problems issues people’s health bladder cancer damages cells.
The COVID-19 reminder health planet linked health humans. Evidence proves virus zoonotic, meaning transmitted people animals. They accountable seventy-five percent emerging infectious diseases World. With Virus infecting millions people day globe, Various governments agencies’ top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes (especially clinical medical waste). Likewise, time, responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears.

In Spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, History witnessed rise pollution “post-financial crisis”. A similar case observed 2008 financial crash – temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. After all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. To prevent future outbreaks, address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends Earth’s life.
If live spacious outdoor area, desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space walk in, begin realize beauty nature. The point remain indoors, avoid close contact others. When leave home, walk desert run street, make wipe surfaces contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands.
