Deep learning impact areas e-learning? - Blackcoffer Insights

eLearning technology affordable higher education big barrier cost developing resources. Deep learning artificial intelligence continues popular impacts areas eLearning. It offers online learners future intuitive algorithms automated delivery eLearning content modern LMS platforms. This paper aims survey applications deep learning approaches developing resources eLearning platform, predictions, algorithms, analytics create personalized future eLearning experiences. In addition, deep learning models developing contents eLearning platform, deep learning framework enable deep learning systems eLearning development, benefits & future trends deep learning eLearning, relevant deep learning-based artificial intelligence tools, platform enabling developer learners quickly reuse resources summarized. Thus, deep learning evolved developing ways re-purpose existing resources mitigate expense content development future eLearning.
It natural tools avoid time expense developing own. Don’t worry advert AIaaS “AI Service” small education learning & development professionals purchase license tools components. However, types tools e-learning ecosystem offer enticing benefits adding standard tasks (logic, decision making) toolbox. Here AIaaS tools platforms offered famous tech giants cloud-based.

There AIaaS platforms DataRobot, Petuum, H2O shows field expanding.AI make human workers obsolete, long time To put fears bed: robots coming jobs, yet. Given artificial intelligence portrayed media, favorite sci-fi movies, it’s clear advent technology created fear day make human beings obsolete workforce. After all, technology advanced, tasks executed human hands automated. It’s natural fear leap creating intelligent computers herald beginning end work it. But, I don’t reason fatalistic. A recent paper published MIT Task Force Work Future entitled “Artificial Intelligence And The Future Work,” looked closely developments relation world work. The paper paints optimistic picture.
Rather promoting obsolescence human labor, paper predicts continue drive massive innovation fuel existing industries potential create sectors growth, ultimately leading creation jobs. While made major strides replicating efficacy human intelligence executing tasks, major limitations. In particular, programs typically capable “specialized” intelligence, meaning solve problem, execute task time. Often, rigid, unable respond input, perform “thinking” prescribed programming. Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” kind problem-solving, abstract thinking, critical judgment continue important business. Human judgment relevant, task, level sectors. There factors limit runaway advancement AI. requires “learning” involve massive amounts data, calling question availability kind data, highlighting categorization issues privacy security data. There limitation computation processing power. The cost electricity power supercharged language model estimated $4.6 million. Another important limitation note data carry bias, reflective societal inequities implicit biases designers create input data. If bias data inputted AI, bias carry results generated AI.
There bill introduced Congress entitled Algorithmic Accountability Act goal forcing Federal Trade Commission investigate technology potential perpetuate bias. Based factors others, MIT CCI paper argues long reaching point comparable human intelligence, theoretically replace human workers entirely. Provided investment levels, education private sector governmental organizations—anywhere focuses training upskilling workers—AI potential ultimately create jobs, less. The question “humans computers” “humans computers” involved complex systems advance industry prosperity. This paper fascinating read hoping dive deeper potential directions lead.AI Is standard businesses, world tech A couple times recently, conversation client associate, I’m noticing fallacy people thinking it. There sense phenomenon big impacts tech world. In case hadn’t noticed, tech world world days. Don’t forget economist Paul Krugman 1998 “By 2005 so, clear Internet’s impact economy greater fax machine’s.” You don’t curve AI. In fact, 90% leading businesses ongoing investments technologies. More half businesses implemented manner AI-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity. strong impact sectors particular:
Medical:
The potential benefits utilizing field medicine explored. The medical industry robust amount data, utilized create predictive models related healthcare. Additionally, shown effective physicians diagnostic contexts.
Automotive:
We’re impacting world transportation automobiles advent autonomous vehicles autonomous navigation. major impact manufacturing, including automotive sector.
Cybersecurity:
Cybersecurity front mind business leaders, spike cybersecurity breaches 2020. Attacks rose 600% pandemic hackers capitalized people working home, secure technological systems, Wi-Fi networks. machine learning critical tools identifying predicting threats cybersecurity. crucial asset security world finance, process large amounts data predict catch instances fraud.
E-Commerce:
play pivotal role e-commerce future, sector industry user experience marketing fulfillment distribution. We expect moving forward, continue drive e-commerce, including chat-bots, shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, warehouse inventory automation.
big impact job search
If moving forward hope hiring manager give benefit doubt small misstep application, rude awakening. plays major role hiring process, 75% resumes rejected automated applicant tracking system, ATS reach human being. In past, recruiters devote considerable time poring resumes relevant candidates. Data LinkedIn shows recruiters spend 23 hours resumes successful hire.
Increasingly, however, resume scanning AI-powered programs. In 2018, 67% hiring managers stated making jobs easier. Despite increasing prevalence automation algorithms hiring process, critical types hiring managers, based charge perpetuate create bias hiring. One illustrated HireVue, startup initial services included technology aimed facial recognition software psychology determine potential effectiveness candidate role. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed lawsuit Federal Trade Commission alleging software potential perpetuate bias prejudice. HireVue discontinued facial recognition software early 2021, audio analysis natural language processing. It’s clear types hiring process controversial technology develops. However, potential employers process application, reason utilizing similar technology advantage.
Jobscan excellent resource similar resume scanning hiring manager. By comparing resume job description, Jobscan give information tweak resume good match position, goal “beating” applicant tracking system (ATS).
