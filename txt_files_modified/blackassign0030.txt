What Creation Taking Over Creator? - Blackcoffer Insights

Human minds, fascination carrying potential tinkering nature pixie dust intelligence, creating solving mysteries wonders admiration. However, matter captivating human mind be, appalled. It hunger desire more, unravel limitations, pure greed. Humans stopped evolving intelligence makes supreme.
Intelligence calls supremacy so, evolve opposed challenge human minds, capabilities making question importance themselves? Artificial Intelligence revolution, havoc light. The concept making machines work own, granting machines –The Intelligence.
The idea making machines work humans back 19s. Back people didn’t thing making non-living thing work, think, carry tasks own, mention, surpass humans skills. The facts did. By 1997. The greatest chess player, Garry Kasparov defeated chess game machine exactly, top skilled human lost mere machine created could’ve defeated him. It rule power, betterment, skills, granted supremacy. Were Machines tools? Equipment? Something helped unskilled person mind intelligence creates skilled work perfection precision? Well initially was, however, time passed humans drawn puzzle AI, lot changed. Human research deeper deeper result, machines evolved it.
At present, & Machines growing field. As develops improves, part industrial revolution. In industries, laborious work care humans replaced machines. Naturally, evolution machines, precision, mass productivity, quality control, time efficiencies, factors made choice. A choice humans.
This led fear, fear not-so-distant future, future machines evolved they’ll human employee leading unemployment. With population increase world, tech threat labor market. Then again… true it? Does oppose threat? Will adapting technology make millions people lose jobs? Will lead mass unemployment? Will machines surpass humans? Will, creation creator?
No matter fearful future seem, reality, scary. Truth present reality, key holds power unlock level human evolution. Technology growing. There time technology idea, today idea implemented, it’s working carried out. Nobody stop advancement growth Artificial Intelligence, it’s wave flowing present generation generations learn, learn swim flow avoid drowning.
Many jobs replaced machines, evolves it’ll challenging human minds skills. With present COVID 19 situation, contactless cashiers robots delivering packages usual routine tasks. The jobs Secretaries, Schedulers, book-keeper risk too. Manufacturing units, agriculture, food services, retail, transportation & logistic, hospitality part AI-affected automation. At estimation, 20 million jobs, including manufacturing lost robots. As AI, robotics, 3D printing, genetics make in, architects, medical docs, music composers feel threatened technology. Making question edge brain jobs too? Now terrifying.
However, machines replacing jobs, they’ll creating jobs. With economic growth, innovation, investment 133 million jobs generated. These newly enhanced jobs create benefits amplify one’s creativity, strategy, entrepreneurial skills. So catch?
Well, it’s skills. Even creating 3 times jobs destroying, it’s skills count. surged job opportunities, opportunities Senior Data Scientist, Mobile Application Developer, SEO specialist. These jobs heard it’s born, however, jobs qualification, high-level skills acquire skills expensive time-consuming task. The future generation cope real struggle faced present generations.

Howsoever, it’s totally control, proves choice, limitations present. First, it’s expensive, secondly, manufacturing machines bulk good environment. Machines high maintenance, human labor cheaper considered machines. Underdeveloped countries find hard equip people upskilling reskilling required workplace play role countries, years. risky unethical, it’s hard figure held responsible cases wrong.
No matter, advanced gets, skills humans upper hand i.e., soft skills. Skills teamwork, communication, creativity, critical thinking hasn’t beat creativity, leadership, emotional intelligence increased. Although, machines coming humans causing lack human-to-human interaction, humans fade little.

In conclusion, machines challenging there’s humans haven’t overcome. Adaptation up-gradation primary factor survival. As witness onset 4th industrial revolution, let’s buckle seats race highway essential fuels (skills) eliminated. After all, unending race infinity end, run fuel. Try outdated.
