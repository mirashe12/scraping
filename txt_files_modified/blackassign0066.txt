What chance Homo sapiens survive 500 years? - Blackcoffer Insights

We’ve year. Like insatiable glutton, law averages home roost. We should’ve hint 1st January, 66 people lost lives Jakarta floods. What highlights reel disaster movie franchise – volcanic eruption The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires Australia, earthquakes Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, China. And speaking China.
2020 brought home fragile mortality human race sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past grim 1 million marks, choice question place universe – all-conquering masters domain, mere tourists ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is human race ubiquitous three-part literary arc defines story, life, civilization – ascent, apex, descent? Maybe Michael Jackson unveiled moonwalk 1983, Barack Obama stepped White House President United States 2008, MS Dhoni lifted Cricket World Cup 2011, peaked, species, steady unraveling.
500 years long time. For context, world population 1500 AD mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion unprecedented history, tip iceberg. Though fertility rates dropping people foregoing chance babies, crossed threshold – population projections year 2050 9.8 billion, 2100 whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere there, Malthus cackling grave. The year 2500 suddenly long off, conversation ever-more pertinent today. The Bulletin Atomic Scientists optimistic – famed Doomsday Clock maintain closest ‘midnight’ (our proximity global catastrophe), inception 1947. Global warming? Check. The threat nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check.
And yet, hope floats, reasons. Mankind back wall now, shoots potential make 2500 AD – advent basket disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering), private sector focus space exploration terraforming, good fashioned human resilience. While factors doubt critical human survival, pin hopes – long-demonstrated history surviving nature, universe, self-destructive tendency, throws way.
The Next Superman?
In 13th century, Italian town Pisa, enterprising tinkerer developed eyeglasses, local friar weakening eyesight2. All sudden, existed external device amplify senses, tool gave advantage survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate eyeglasses entirely. Hearing aids give gift auditory perception back world muffled voices unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely augmented reality tool measure length objects front us.
But real science starts imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables, virtual reality tools ubiquitous decades. But that? Science answer, it’s thrilling scary. Artificial intelligence stuff fable, filler questions left unanswered. But AI, combined bio-enhancement genetic engineering, lead evolution calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau smarter, faster, agile, equipped adapt promises world VUCA imaginations. What human like?
They small chip embedded brain utilizes artificial intelligence enhanced sensory perception. What mean? It means better, focuses attention longer, hears hear, communicate reaction rest body. Through chemical blood, chip demand response body. Bio-augmentation limbs organs, internal external, person longer determined birth, simply bought. All sudden, average Joe run faster Usain Bolt, swim Michael Phelps, and…fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering missing link. Already feverish conversations dystopian future featuring designer babies digital divide simply overcome inbuilt one’s DNA. The breakthrough CRISPR-Cas9 key unlock mysteries DNA manipulation. So there’s food left? Our body adjust appetite accordingly. No water? Absorb humidity air specialized pores skin. The human 2500 AD recognize today. That shot.
Galactic Dominance
SpaceX, led mercurial leader Elon Musk, leader here. The SpaceX Mars Programme based simple premise – earth’s closest planet terms distance terrestrial conditions, Mars bet colonization. Musk invested billions dollars Mars Space Programme remains fervent believer concept. And tech visionaries, Musk alone. Jeff Bezos, richest man world, owns Blue Origin, simply aims make spaceflight cheaper incremental technological growth. Bezos, online retailer books turned ever-expanding behemoth, man thinks small. With business leaders finding spaceflight planetary colonization tantalizing prospect, inevitably concerted push developing actual colony planet. And pull-factor development starts hitting diminishing returns, inevitable push factor global warming increase eruption pandemics begin toll. It feasible option people find alternate home, Mars, Saturn’s moons.
A human colony Mars sounds concept straight science fiction, permanent station Antarctica decades ago. Mount Everest unapproachable summit ahead planted flag peak. Today, hundreds people year attempt climb. As spaceflight reasonable, urge explore supersedes inertia investment, closer chance survival – leaving planet earth finding home, forgiving follies.
The Human Spirit
The introduction article includes illustrative list disasters misfortunes struck global community year. And yet, survive. Businesses surge ahead, people adapt world masks social distancing, world on. Earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, we’ve survived, human race, intrepid exploration world, pushes onward upward. Technological visionaries envision future rest see, invest money vision. Gradually, unthinkable suddenly real – moon landing that. Google launched Google Glass augmented reality wearable technology, suddenly foresee future smart eyewear. While product didn’t catch on, doesn’t companies aren’t trying. Bio-augmentation fast-developing industry, CRISPR-Cas9, “genetic scissors” held back regulatory bottlenecks. How long prospect fiddling gene code luxury necessity? The human spirit, tendency survive thrive costs, eventually win.
The human race survive 2500, doubt. The real question is, person exists 2500, bionic chips bio-enhanced body structure modified genetic code, called Homo sapien? Or Homo nouveau forward?
